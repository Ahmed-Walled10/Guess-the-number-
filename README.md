# Guess the number
 "Guess the Number" is an interactive game implemented in x86 Assembly Language using emu 8086. It challenges the user to think algorithmically as the program attempts to guess a number chosen by the user using the [binary search algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/).

 # Features
 - Binary Search Algorithm:
   The program implements a binary search to guess the user's chosen number efficiently.
It narrows down the range of possible numbers using comparisons (min, max, and mid values).
- Custom Input Handling:
A PROC to read user input ensures robust number entry and allows dynamic inputs.
Input validation ensures only positive numbers are accepted and right inputs.
- Time efficiency:
  We use in our project an Efficient algorithm with logarithmic time complexity O(logn).
  and it's better than the normal liner search the takes O(n).
