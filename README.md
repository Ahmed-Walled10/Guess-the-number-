# Guess the number
 "Guess the Number" is an interactive game implemented in x86 Assembly Language using TASM (Turbo Assembler). It challenges the user to think algorithmically as the program attempts to guess a number chosen by the user using the [binary search algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/).
